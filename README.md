## Professional experience : 2017
**Internship at CNESST (Quebec city)**
- Analyze the possibility of applying the principles of artificial intelligence to redesign an application
- Elaborate a prototype of a question-answer system that allows to implement the suggested solution using Python

CNESST is a government agency in Quebec, Canada responsible for promoting and enforcing workplace health and safety standards, as well as resolving disputes related to workplace accidents and injuries.
I was working with the head of solution design to demonstrate that AI can be used to redesign a solution. 
This solution classifies employers into units based on the activities carried out by their employees to determine the premium rate and the periodic payment rate for employees. 
The application used about 100,000 business rules to reach a classification.
To simplify the development of business rules, I presented a prototype implemented using the Python programming language that showcases a modeling approach using **supervised learning** and regular expressions.

## Acedemic projects : 2015 - 2017
